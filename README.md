# DiceGame
A simple simulated game of craps made with python that takes no input from the user.

An even money bet, made on the first roll of the dice (known as the “come out roll”). You win if a 7 or 11 roll, or lose if 2, 3, or 12 roll (known as “craps”).
Any other number that rolls becomes the “point” and the point must roll again before a 7 to win.
